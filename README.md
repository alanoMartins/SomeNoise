### Status: WIP

This is a practical exercise for image processing class.

## Problem

Add noise in the image using some distribution functions studied

## Proposed solution

1. Create a vector X between -255 and 255
2. Obtain the probability density function (p.d.f) using a distribution of the index below.
3. Calculate the cumulative density function (c.d.f)
4. Use a linear random function to generate random number
5. Search the nearest value in c.d.f data
6. Generate and apply this noise mask in some image

> This is a demonstration proposal for educational purposes
